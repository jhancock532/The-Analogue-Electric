      "When *I* use a word", Humpty Dumpty said in
      a rather scornful tone, "It means just what
      I choose it to mean - neither more or less."

      "The question is", said Alice "whether you
      *can* make words mean so many different things."

      "The question is", said Humpty Dumpty, "which
      is to be Master - that's all." (p125)

        "Kitty, can you play chess? ... you watched
        just as if you understood it: and when I said
        'check!' you purred!" (p7) ... The chessmen
        were walking about, two and two!" (p14)
        
        Through the Looking Glass

        There was an enormous black cat sitting on a 
        stool in front of the chessboard and holding a
        knight in its right paw (p239) ... Margarita 
        was fascinated by the game and amazed to see 
        that the chessmen were alive. (p242)
