    "When I use a word", Humpty Dumpty said in
    a rather scornful tone, "It means just what
    I choose it to mean - neither more or less".

    "The question is", said Alice "whether you
    can make words mean so many different things".

    "The question is", said Humpty Dumpty, "which
    is to be Master - that's all"

    Remember the circuit flow beneath your fingers<br>
    The analogue reality of the internet<br>
    Electricity connects us<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    Note the textures that stem from your feelings<br>
    The nervous system messages from our body<br>
    Electricity connects us<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    We are left with the present moment<br>
    Neurons fire with awareness and perception<br>
    Electricity connects us
